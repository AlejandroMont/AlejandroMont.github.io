				This project contains two maps I created using different platforms, Google MyMaps and Fulcrum. "The Soccer Tour" was created by inputting in an 
				Excel sheet data such as latitude and longitude from each Soccer field, a short description of the place, and a secondary description like the link 
				of the facilities or park where these soccer fields are located. All these attributes are displayed when the user clicks on one of the blue icons. 
				The blue line on "The Soccer Tour" map shows a route from the beginning point of the tour to the furthest point. The distance between these 
				two points is about 12.2 miles.<br> 
				The second map was created using an app called Fulcrum to create the data, and Carto to create the map. To collect the data for the coffee shops 
				my project partner and I went to each place to take a photo of the shop using the Fulcrum app and to rate the coziness level. The criteria for 
				coziness level was previously established based on studying space and the type of art on the walls.
